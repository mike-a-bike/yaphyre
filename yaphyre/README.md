# Yet Another Physics based Renderer #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mike-a-bike/yaphyre.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mike-a-bike/yaphyre)

A simple, physics based non biased renderer. The base shall be a raytracer which can then be expanded by additional rendering algorithms like global illumination, photon mapping and so on.

There is no ambition behind this project to create another, brilliant rendering engine. There are already some incredibly good examples for that. The driver behind this project is to satisfy my own curiosity.

First rendering: A simple scene with a sphere, a plane and one pointlight.
